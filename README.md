# This is Pressure Cook Project.

- Use Arduino.ino for all your coding.
- But first create a branch of the git using folllowing command in bash "git branch [Your name]"
- To change the branch and do the commit, type command "git checkout [Which branch you want to go]"
- Final_code.ino is the working code for the pressure cooker.
